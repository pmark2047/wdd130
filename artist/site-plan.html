      <p>
        I've been playing music since I was 7 years old when I started taking piano lessons. Growing up I found it as a unique way to express myself in a way that words couldn't and I loved to write arrangements of church hymns and other songs that I loved. Over time I've had lots of people ask me for the sheet music of my own arrangements and compositions. This site is so that I can share that music and expression for those who want to listen and learn the material I've written throughout my life. Over time, I plan to fill this site with videos, mp3s, sheet music, and chords so that my music can be out for all to experience and enjoy.
      </p>
      <h4>Videos</h4>
      <p>
        On this page, you can explore a variety of videos featuring songs and compositions I've written. The collection spans different emotions and perspectives of my own life. Here I have live performances as well as some post-production for a short film I scored.
      </p>
      <h4>Sheet Music</h4>
      <p>
        This section provides sheet music for my compositions, featuring various styles and difficulty levels. Whether you're an experienced musician or a beginner, explore the scores to play and interpret the pieces yourself.
      </p>
      <h4>Audio</h4>
      <p>
        Here, you can access the MP3 files of my compositions. Dive into a collection of musical styles and pieces, suitable for all preferences. Whether you're a dedicated music enthusiast or a casual listener, enjoy the convenience of direct access to the audio files.
